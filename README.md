First project of the first programming course at VAMK

The project was done using the basics of html, css and js/jquery. 
The idea of the project is to display orders (sample data from json) and to be able to print them out into a .pdf file.

This project was graded on a scale of 1-5 receiving grade 4.

The project took appx. 2 weeks to complete alone, doing other schoolwork at the same time.
